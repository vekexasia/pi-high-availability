# pi-high-availability 🔄

**pi-high-availability** automatically switches to fallback LLM providers when your primary provider hits quota limits or capacity constraints. Never get stuck waiting for quota resets again.

## 🆕 What's New in v2.2.0

---

**Per-Session Group Selection** — You can now specify which HA group to use via the `--ha-group` CLI flag. This is useful when running multiple pi instances with different failover chains.

### Usage

```bash
# Use default group (from ha.json defaultGroup)
pi -e .pi/extensions/gastown-hooks.js

# Use specific group via --ha-group
pi -e .pi/extensions/gastown-hooks.js --ha-group paid --model openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
```

This allows you to configure different gastown workers to use different HA groups based on their role.

### How It Works

When pi starts with `--ha-group paid`:
1. Extension reads the flag value (`paid`)
2. Validates the group exists in `ha.json`
3. Sets `state.activeGroup = "paid"`
4. All failover events use models from the "paid" group

When pi starts without `--ha-group`:
1. Falls back to `defaultGroup` from `ha.json`
2. All failover events use models from that group

**Network Error Handling** — The extension now detects transient network errors (connection resets, timeouts, internal network failures) and handles them separately from capacity/quota errors. By default, network errors trigger an immediate retry after 1 second, since they're usually temporary infrastructure issues that don't indicate a problem with your credentials.

**Configurable Error Handling** — You can now control how the extension responds to different types of errors:

- **Capacity Errors** (e.g., "out of capacity", "engine overloaded"): These affect all accounts for a provider equally, so switching accounts doesn't help. Now you can choose to `stop`, `retry` after a timeout, or jump to `next_provider`.
  
- **Quota Errors** (e.g., "rate limit exceeded", "insufficient quota"): These are per-account, so switching to another OAuth key or API key may solve the problem. Choose from `stop`, `retry`, `next_provider`, or `next_key_then_provider` (default).

Configure these in `/ha` under **⚙️ Settings** or directly in `ha.json` (see [Error Handling Configuration](#error-handling-configuration)).

## ✨ Features

- **Unified HA Manager**: A beautiful interactive TUI (`/ha`) with accordion-style navigation to manage all your groups and credentials in one place.
- **Automatic Multi-Tier Failover**: 
    1. **Account Failover**: Seamlessly switches between multiple accounts for the *same* provider.
    2. **Provider Failover**: Automatically jumps to the next provider in your group if all accounts for the current provider are exhausted.
- **Exhaustion Tracking**: Intelligent cooldown management marks specific accounts or providers as "exhausted" on 429/capacity errors, preventing retries until they recover.
- **Dynamic Provider Discovery**: Automatically detects all supported Pi providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Moonshot, Zai, etc.) without configuration.
- **Group Management**: Create custom failover chains (e.g., "Fast Tier" → "Backup Tier") and rearrange model priority with simple keybindings.
- **Credential Sync & Storage**: Automatically capture OAuth logins or manually add API keys for backup accounts.
- **Smart Error Detection**: Distinguishes between quota errors and transient capacity issues, including full support for Google Gemini's internal retry patterns.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Extension

```bash
pi install npm:pi-high-availability
```

### 2. Open the Manager

Run the High Availability manager to initialize your configuration:

```bash
/ha
```

### 3. Configure Your First Group

1.  Select **📂 Groups**.
2.  Add or select a group (e.g., `default`).
3.  Add Model IDs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet`) to the group.
4.  Use **`u`** and **`d`** keys to rearrange the priority.

## 🎮 The HA Manager (`/ha`)

The interactive manager is your control center for high availability.

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate items |
| `Space` / `→` | Expand/collapse section or toggle item |
| `Enter` | Select/activate item |
| `x` / `d` / `Delete` | Delete currently selected item (with confirmation) |
| `u` | Move item up (reorder) |
| `d` | Move item down (reorder) |
| `Esc` | Cancel / Exit |

### 📂 Group Management
*   **Add/Rename/Delete** groups.
*   **Rearrange Priority**: Use **`u`** (up) and **`d`** (down) keys to set the failover order of models within a group.
*   **Per-Entry Cooldown**: Set custom recovery times for specific models.
*   **Delete Models**: Navigate to any model entry and press **`x`** to remove it from the group.

### 🔑 Credential Management
*   **Auto-Sync**: Credentials from `/login` are automatically synced when you open `/ha`.
*   **Add API Providers**: Use **"+ Add API Provider"** to manually add providers that use API keys.
*   **Add API Keys**: For non-OAuth providers, add additional API keys as backups.
*   **Account Priority**: Use **`u`** and **`d`** keys to decide which account is `primary` and which are `backup-1`, `backup-2`, etc.
*   **Delete Keys**: Navigate to any key entry and press **`x`** to delete it.
*   **Delete Providers**: Navigate to a provider header (e.g., `🔌 google-gemini-cli`) and press **`x`** to delete the entire provider and all its keys.

### ⏱️ Settings
*   **Default Cooldown**: Set the default recovery time (e.g., 3600000ms for 1 hour) for exhausted providers.
*   **Default Group**: Choose which failover chain Pi uses when it starts up.
*   **Error Handling**: Configure how different error types are handled:
    *   **Capacity Error Action**: What to do when a provider reports "out of capacity" (doesn't help to switch accounts for the same provider)
    *   **Quota Error Action**: What to do when a provider reports quota/rate limit exceeded (switching accounts may help)
    *   **Retry Timeout**: How long to wait before retrying when using "retry" action (default: 300000ms = 5 minutes)

## 🔍 How Failover Works

### The Failover Chain
When a quota or capacity error is detected:
1.  **Try Next Account**: The extension looks for another credential for the *same* provider (e.g., your second Google account).
2.  **Mark Exhausted**: The current account is marked as exhausted and won't be used again until its cooldown expires.
3.  **Switch Provider**: If all accounts for that provider are exhausted, the extension looks at the **Active Group** and switches to the next provider/model in the list.
4.  **Automatic Retry**: Pi automatically resends your last message using the new provider and primary account, making the transition transparent.

### Error Detection
The extension detects:
*   **Quota Errors**: HTTP 429, "rate limit", "insufficient quota", etc.
*   **Capacity Errors**: "No capacity available", "Engine Overloaded", etc.
*   **Gemini Awareness**: Correctly waits for Google's internal retry attempts before triggering a failover.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide (`ha.json`)

While you should use the `/ha` UI, you can also manually edit `~/.pi/agent/ha.json`:

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "pro": {
      "name": "Professional Tier",
      "entries": [
        { "id": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet" },
        { "id": "google-gemini-cli/gemini-1.5-pro", "cooldownMs": 1800000 }
      ]
    }
  },
  "defaultGroup": "pro",
  "defaultCooldownMs": 3600000,
  "errorHandling": {
    "capacityErrorAction": "next_provider",
    "quotaErrorAction": "next_key_then_provider",
    "networkErrorAction": "retry",
    "retryTimeoutMs": 300000,
    "networkRetryDelayMs": 1000
  },
  "credentials": {
    "anthropic": {
      "primary": { "type": "oauth", "refresh": "...", "access": "..." },
      "backup-1": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Configuration

The `errorHandling` section in `ha.json` lets you customize how the extension responds to different error types:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `capacityErrorAction` | Action when provider has no capacity (affects all accounts) | `next_key_then_provider` |
| `quotaErrorAction` | Action when account hits rate limit (may not affect other accounts) | `next_key_then_provider` |
| `networkErrorAction` | Action when transient network error occurs | `retry` |
| `retryTimeoutMs` | How long to wait before retrying capacity/quota errors (ms) | `300000` (5 minutes) |
| `networkRetryDelayMs` | How long to wait before retrying network errors (ms) | `1000` (1 second) |

#### Understanding the Error Types

**Network Errors** occur due to transient infrastructure issues. Examples:
- "Internal network failure"
- "Connection reset" / "Connection refused"
- "ETIMEDOUT" / "ECONNRESET"
- "Socket hang up" / "Fetch failed"

These are temporary issues that usually resolve quickly. The default action is `retry` after 1 second. Unlike quota/capacity errors, credentials are **not** marked as exhausted for network errors.

**Capacity Errors** occur when a provider's servers are overloaded. Examples:
- "No capacity available for this model"
- "Engine overloaded"
- "Service temporarily unavailable"

These errors affect the provider's infrastructure, so switching to a different account for the same provider typically won't help. Recommended action: `next_provider` or `retry`.

**Quota Errors** occur when an account exceeds its limits. Examples:
- "Rate limit exceeded (429)"
- "Insufficient quota"
- "Daily limit reached"

These errors are per-account, so switching to another OAuth entry or API key for the same provider may solve the problem. Recommended action: `next_key_then_provider` (default) or `next_provider` if you don't have backup accounts.

#### Available Actions

The following actions can be configured for both `capacityErrorAction` and `quotaErrorAction`:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `stop` | Stop the process and display the error (default if pi-high-availability is not installed) |
| `retry` | Wait for `retryTimeoutMs` milliseconds, then retry the same request |
| `next_provider` | Immediately switch to the next provider in the current group |
| `next_key_then_provider` | Try the next account/key for the current provider, then move to next provider if all exhausted (default) |

**Note:** For capacity errors, `next_key_then_provider` is often not helpful since all accounts for the same provider typically share the same capacity pool. Use `next_provider` or `retry` for capacity errors instead.
